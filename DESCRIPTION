Description: We use a Bayesian approach to run individual patient data meta-analysis and network meta-analysis using 'JAGS'. The methods incorporate shrinkage methods and calculate patient-specific treatment effects as described in Seo et al. (2021) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8859>. This package also includes user-friendly functions that impute missing data in an individual patient data using mice-related packages.
