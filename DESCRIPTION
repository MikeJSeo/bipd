Description: We use a Bayesian approach to run individual patient data meta analysis. The methods allow shrinkage of effect modifiers as described in Seo et al. This package is a user friendly application that can run models without having to code a JAGS model. The program takes the input data and transforms it to a suitable format of analysis, generates a JAGS model and runs the model through the rjags package. Furthermore, package includes functions to calculate measures such as patient-specific treatment effect.
